# Deletion Agents

This folder holds the sub agents regarding and related to the deletion of existing schedule items. 

## [Equipment](equipment/)

The subagent involves the deleting of a single piece of equipment for the user. The sub agent will ask in a loop for clarifying details until the user has provided it with enough information to only have one piece of equipment. `Future implementations will allow the user to say that they want to delete all of the pieces of equipment listed.`
