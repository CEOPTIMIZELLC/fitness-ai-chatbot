# Reading Agents

This folder holds the sub agents regarding and related to the creation of new schedule items. 

## [Equipment](equipment/)

The subagent involves the reading of the list of equipment that have the details that the user specifies.

## [Availability](availability/)

The subagent involves the reading of the user's weekday availability. The sub agent will parse the user's input to determine whether the user wants to: see all of their availabilities or see their currently active availability. `Future implementations will allow the user to see availabilities that fall into desired parameters.`

## [Macrocycles/Goals](macrocycles/)

The subagent involves the reading of the user's macrocycles. The sub agent will parse the user's input to determine whether the user wants to: see all of their macrocycles or see their currently active macrocycle. `Future implementations will allow the user to see macrocycles that fall into desired parameters.`

## [Mesocycles/Phases](mesocycles/)

The subagent involves the reading of the user's mesocycles. The sub agent will parse the user's input to determine whether the user wants to: see all of their mesocycles, see all mesocycles within their currently active macrocycle, or see their currently active mesocycle. `Future implementations will allow the user to read mesocycles that fall into desired parameters.`

## [Microcycles/Weekly Schedule](microcycles/)

The subagent involves the reading of the user's microcycles. The sub agent will parse the user's input to determine whether the user wants to: see all of their microcycles, see all microcycles within their currently active mesocycle, or see their currently active microcycle. `Future implementations will allow the user to read microcycles that fall into desired parameters.`

## [Phase Components for Each Week Day](phase_components/)

The subagent involves the reading of the user's phase components. The sub agent will parse the user's input to determine whether the user wants to: see all of their phase components, see all phase components within their currently active microcycle, or see their currently active phase component. `Future implementations will allow the user to read phase components that fall into desired parameters.`

## [Exercises/Daily Workouts](workout_schedule/)

The subagent involves the reading of the user's workouts. The sub agent will parse the user's input to determine whether the user wants to: see all of their workouts or see their currently active workout. `Future implementations will allow the user to read workouts that fall into desired parameters.`
