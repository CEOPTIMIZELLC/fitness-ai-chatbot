# Macrocycles/Goals

## Description

The subagent involves the creation of a new active macrocycle. The sub agent will parse the user's input and determine what goal type it falls into. 

## Future Features

* Allow the user to clarify when they want it to start, rather than having it start at the current date.

## Example Output

```
